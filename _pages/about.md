Jun Huo received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2018 and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2025. My current research interests include rehabilitation assistive robotic systems (wearable robots) and medical robots.

My current research focus on human-centered wearable rehabilitation assistive robot, including supernumerary robotic limb (SRL), exoskeletons and other bio-inspired robots. My research lies in the combination of mechanism design, optimization, and learning-based control.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
